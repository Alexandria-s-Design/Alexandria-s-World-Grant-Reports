## Alexandria's World Connection

**Why It's NOT a Direct Fit:**
- Award is for **libraries** to host authors, not for authors
- Alexandria's World is author-focused, not library-focused

**Indirect Strategic Value:**
- **Library Marketing:** If libraries choose to host Dr. Marie Martin for an Alexandria's World author visit
- **Book Sales:** Library events generate book purchases and community engagement
- **Community Building:** Library visits build local readership and support

**How to Leverage:**
- Encourage libraries to apply for this award to host Marie Martin
- Prepare compelling library event proposal around Alexandria's World books
- Position Alexandria's World as culturally responsive children's literature perfect for library programming

---

**Materials Needed:**
- Library information
- Plan for author/illustrator visit
- Proposed budget within $4,000
- Description of how event serves children/teens

**Application:** March 13 - April 10, 2026
