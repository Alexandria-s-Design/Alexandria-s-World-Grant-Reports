## Budget Narrative

### Why Illustration is the Largest Expense

Professional children's book illustration is the single most critical factor in book success for young readers (ages 4-8). High-quality, culturally accurate illustrations:

1. **Engage young readers** — Picture books are visual-first; illustrations determine whether children pick up the book
2. **Ensure cultural authenticity** — Swedish illustrator with knowledge of Hälsingland folk art ensures accurate, respectful representation
3. **Support educational goals** — Visuals help explain abstract concepts (World Heritage, cultural preservation) to young children
4. **Enable library adoption** — Libraries prioritize well-illustrated books for their picture book collections

At ~$2,850 for two books (~1,425 SEK or $135 per page), this budget is conservative compared to industry standards ($150-$200/page is typical). The scholarship funding enables professional-quality work that will be competitive in the children's literature market.

### Cultural Review Budget

The 5,000 SEK ($475) for editorial services includes:

- **Copyediting** (~2,000 SEK): Professional line editing for both manuscripts
- **Cultural Review** (~3,000 SEK): Compensation for Sámi and Swedish cultural consultants to review manuscripts for authenticity, respect, and accuracy

Cultural consultants deserve fair compensation for their expertise and time. This budget ensures the project honors the cultures it represents and builds trusting relationships with cultural communities.

### Educational Module Design

The 4,000 SEK ($380) for educational design includes:

- **Graphic design** of printable worksheets and activity sheets
- **Teacher guide formatting** aligned with NHES standards
- **Professional layout** ensuring materials are classroom-ready

Educators are more likely to adopt materials that are professionally designed and ready to use immediately. This investment increases the project's educational impact.
