## Risk Management

**Potential Risks & Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **UNESCO scholarship not awarded** — Apply to alternative funding (National Geographic, Asian Cultural Council, NEA)
2. **Cultural consultant unavailable** — Build relationships with multiple consultants during pre-residency phase
3. **Illustrator delays** — Build timeline buffer and identify backup illustrators
4. **Distribution challenges** — Leverage existing Alexandria's Design networks and UNESCO partnerships
5. **Low educator adoption** — Professional educational design, alignment with NHES standards, teacher outreach
