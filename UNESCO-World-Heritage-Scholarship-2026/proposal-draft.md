# UNESCO World Heritage Residence/Scholarship 2026
## Application Proposal: Alexandria's World

---

## 1. Project Title

**"Alexandria's World: Bridging Nordic and Indigenous Cultural Heritage Through Children's Literature"**

---

## 2. World Heritage Site Connection

### Chosen World Heritage Site: Laponian Area, Sweden

- **Country:** Sweden
- **UNESCO List Number:** 954
- **Location:** Arctic Circle region of northern Sweden

### Alternative Connection (if Laponian Area considered too domestic):

- **Site:** Historic Cairo, Egypt
- **UNESCO List Number:** 89
- **Country:** Egypt

**Note:** Historic Cairo is connected to my existing work on "Alexandria in Abu Dhabi," which explores Arabic culture, peace education, and the greeting "Salaam alaikum" (Peace Be Unto You). This creates a natural bridge between Middle Eastern and Nordic heritage.

---

## 3. How Laponian Area Connects to Decorated Farmhouses of Hälsingland

Both UNESCO sites represent profound connections between cultural heritage, storytelling traditions, and human relationship with place.

### Shared UNESCO Values

**Cultural Heritage Preservation**
- **Hälsingland:** Hand-painted farmhouses preserve centuries of rural craftsmanship, with each painted room telling family stories across generations
- **Laponian Area:** Preserves Sámi indigenous culture, reindeer herding traditions, and sustainable land stewardship spanning millennia
- **Connection:** Both sites demonstrate how cultural memory is embedded in physical spaces and passed to new generations

**Universal Value of Storytelling**
- **Hälsingland:** Farmhouse interiors act as "libraries" of folk art, with painted motifs encoding cultural narratives, religious stories, and family histories
- **Laponian Area:** Yoik songs, oral narratives, and ecological knowledge encode indigenous understandings of place, seasonality, and community
- **Connection:** Both sites represent different modalities of storytelling—visual and oral—that preserve cultural wisdom

**Cultural Exchange**
- **Hälsingland:** Farmhouses served as gathering places for community celebrations, weddings, and cultural ceremonies
- **Laponian Area:** Crossroads between indigenous Sámi culture and modern Swedish society; site of cultural dialogue and negotiation
- **Connection:** Both sites represent "contact zones" where different cultural traditions meet and influence each other

**Knowledge Exchange**
- **Hälsingland:** Repositories of folk art techniques, painting traditions, and rural craftsmanship knowledge
- **Laponian Area:** Repositories of indigenous ecological knowledge, traditional resource management, and sustainable practices
- **Connection:** Both sites embody traditional knowledge systems that offer valuable lessons for contemporary challenges

### Thematic Bridge for Alexandria's World

The project explores how children in different cultures learn about their heritage through architecture, storytelling, and daily life—paralleling Hälsingland's painted farmrooms with Laponian's yoik traditions. Both serve as accessible gateways for children to understand abstract concepts of cultural preservation, identity, and belonging.

For young readers (ages 4-8), the books will:
- Introduce Hälsingland through a child's discovery of painted farmhouses and the stories they tell
- Introduce Sámi culture through age-appropriate experiences with nature, storytelling, and seasonal traditions
- Show how different cultures preserve what matters to them—whether through paint on walls or songs in the air

## 4. Project Idea

### Project Summary

Alexandria's World is a children's book series centering an African American toddler named Alexandria as she experiences diverse cultures through authentic, age-appropriate journeys aligned with the **National History Educational Standards (NHES)** for culture education.

This residency will develop two manuscripts:

#### Book 1: "Alexandria in Hälsingland"
Alexandria visits the decorated farmhouses of Hälsingland, discovering the painted interiors and learning how Swedish families preserved their stories on the walls. Through a child's eyes, she explores:
- The meanings behind painted motifs (flowers, animals, religious scenes)
- How farmhouses served as gathering places for community celebrations
- The craft of folk art and how it's passed from generation to generation
- A child's introduction to cultural preservation: "Why do we save old things?"

#### Book 2: "Alexandria in the North"
Alexandria travels north to learn about Sámi culture (presented developmentally appropriately for young children), discovering:
- How Sámi people live in harmony with nature and the seasons
- Yoik singing as a form of storytelling and memory-keeping
- Indigenous concepts of peace with the environment
- How different ways of living can teach us respect for the earth

### Companion Educational Modules

Each book includes a **companion educational module** aligned with NHES culture standards:

**For "Alexandria in Hälsingland":**
- **Lesson:** "How We Remember Our Stories" — Introducing children to the idea that different cultures have different ways of remembering and preserving what matters
- **Activity:** Creating a "memory wall" where children draw or paint things they want to remember
- **Cultural concept:** Folk art as a way of telling stories without words
- **Peace education:** Understanding that by learning about others' stories, we build peace

**For "Alexandria in the North":**
- **Lesson:** "Learning from Nature" — Introducing children to indigenous ecological knowledge
- **Activity:** Observing nature in their own environment and keeping a "nature journal"
- **Cultural concept:** Different cultures have different relationships with the land
- **Peace education:** Being a peacemaker for the environment — how small actions help the earth

### Project Goals

1. Create culturally authentic children's literature introducing Nordic and indigenous heritage to diverse audiences
2. Develop educational materials aligned with NHES culture standards for K-3 classrooms
3. Foster global citizenship and cultural empathy in young readers (ages 4-8)
4. Model how World Heritage Sites can be accessible gateways to cultural learning for children
5. Demonstrate the value of connecting seemingly disparate cultures through universal themes

### Target Audience

- **Primary:** Children ages 4-8
- **Secondary:** K-3 educators seeking culturally responsive literature
- **Tertiary:** Families interested in global citizenship education
- **Institutional:** World Heritage Site visitor centers and educational programs

### Alignment with Alexandria's World Vision

This project advances the Alexandria's World mission to:
- Center an African American child as cultural explorer, modeling intercultural curiosity
- Create books that teach "How to be a Peacemaker" through authentic cultural experiences
- Build a pipeline of global citizens with cultural understanding
- Align with National History Educational Standards for culture education
- Include practical activities that help children carry cultural lessons into their daily lives

---

## 5. Project in Relation to the World Heritage Concept

This project directly advances UNESCO's World Heritage mission through five key dimensions:

### 1. Cultural Heritage Transmission

The project transforms complex World Heritage concepts into developmentally appropriate narratives for young children:

- **Outstanding Universal Value** — Explained through the idea that some places are so special that the whole world wants to protect them
- **Authenticity** — Introduced through the question "What makes something real or true?" (real painted farmhouses vs. fake decorations)
- **Integrity** — Explored through "keeping things whole" (preserving complete farmhouses, not just fragments)
- **Living Heritage** — Demonstrated through people who still live in the farmhouses and Sámi who still follow traditional practices

By making these concepts accessible to young children, the project creates a foundation for lifelong engagement with World Heritage values.

### 2. Cultural Exchange and Understanding

The series models intercultural empathy and respect:

- Centers an African American child as the cultural explorer, showing that cultural learning is for everyone
- Bridges diverse cultures: African American urban experience, Nordic rural heritage, Arctic indigenous traditions
- Demonstrates that despite surface differences, all cultures share universal concerns: remembering stories, teaching children, living in harmony with the world
- Supports UNESCO's mission of building "peace in the minds of men and women" through early cultural education

### 3. Universal Values

The books explore themes that connect to UNESCO's commitment to universal values:

- **Storytelling** — How all cultures tell stories (paint on walls, songs in the air, words on pages)
- **Preservation** — Why we protect what matters to us (old houses, old songs, old ways of knowing)
- **Connection to Place** — How where we live shapes who we are
- **Intergenerational Learning** — How grandparents teach grandchildren, keeping culture alive

### 4. Conservation and Stewardship

The project introduces concepts of preservation through child-friendly metaphors:

- Cultural preservation as "taking care of stories" like we take care of library books
- Laponian component introduces environmental stewardship as cultural heritage (Sámi sustainable practices)
- Practical activities: children identify what they want to preserve in their own lives (drawings, family traditions, special places)
- Models how World Heritage sites are "treasures" that belong to everyone

### 5. Knowledge Exchange

The residency period enables direct engagement with cultural knowledge holders:

- Time to meet farm owners and hear the stories behind painted rooms
- Potential to connect with Sámi cultural representatives (with appropriate respect and protocols)
- Access to local experts on Swedish folk art and UNESCO values
- Opportunity to gather authentic details that bring the books to life

The project creates a template for how World Heritage sites can become resources for children's literature globally, with educational materials that can be adapted and shared across the UNESCO network.
